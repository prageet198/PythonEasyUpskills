Question:-
Find the average distance traveled in each hour.
Output the hour along with the corresponding average traveled distance.
Sort records by the hour in ascending order.

Solution:-
# Import your libraries
import pandas as pd

# Start writing code
lyft_rides.head()

# Firstly we will create Group by 'hour'
grouped_data = lyft_rides.groupby(['hour'])

# After that we will Calculate mean travel distance for each hour
mean_travel_distance = grouped_data['travel_distance'].mean()

#After performing the calculation we will Convert the result to a DataFrame with column name 'avg_distance'
mean_travel_distance_df = mean_travel_distance.to_frame('avg_distance')

# Now we do the Reset index to turn 'hour' back into a regular column
mean_travel_distance_df = mean_travel_distance_df.reset_index()

# Finally Sort the DataFrame by 'hour'
sorted_result = mean_travel_distance_df.sort_values('hour')
