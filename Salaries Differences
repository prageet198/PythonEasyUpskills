df = pd.merge(db_employee, db_dept, how='left', left_on='department_id', right_on='id')
df_filtered = df[df['department'].isin(['engineering', 'marketing'])]
max_salaries = df_filtered.groupby('department')['salary'].max()
salary_eng = max_salaries.get('engineering', 0)
salary_mkt = max_salaries.get('marketing', 0)
salary_difference = abs(salary_mkt - salary_eng)
result = pd.DataFrame({'salary_difference': [salary_difference]})
