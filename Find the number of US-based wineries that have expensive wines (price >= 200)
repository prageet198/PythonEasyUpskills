Question:-
Find the number of US-based wineries that have expensive wines.
A wine is considered to be expensive if its price is $200 or more.

Solution:-
# Import your libraries
import pandas as pd

# Start writing code
winemag_p1.head()

# First Of All We Will Filter rows where country is 'US' and price is >= 200
filtered_df = winemag_p1[(winemag_p1['country'] == 'US') & (winemag_p1['price'] >= 200)]

# After Filter Select only the 'winery' column
winery_df = filtered_df[['winery']]

# Finally Count the number of unique wineries
unique_wineries_count = winery_df.nunique()

# Display The Result
result = unique_wineries_count
