Question:-
Find the number of rows for each review score earned by 'Hotel Arena'. Output the hotel name (which should be 'Hotel Arena'), 
review score along with the corresponding number of rows with that score for the specified hotel.

Solution:-
# Import your libraries
import pandas as pd

# Start writing code
hotel_reviews.head()

# Firstlt We will Filter reviews for 'Hotel Arena'
arena_reviews = hotel_reviews[hotel_reviews['hotel_name'] == 'Hotel Arena']

# Next We will Group by 'reviewer_score' and 'hotel_name'
grouped_reviews = arena_reviews.groupby(['reviewer_score', 'hotel_name'])

# After creating the group Count the number of reviews in each group
review_counts = grouped_reviews.size()

#Now Convert the  counts to DataFrame & name the count column as 'no_reviews'
counts_df = review_counts.to_frame('no_reviews')

# Finally Reset the index of the DataFrame
# Convert the index (which includes 'reviewer_score' and 'hotel_name') to regular columns
final_result = counts_df.reset_index()
