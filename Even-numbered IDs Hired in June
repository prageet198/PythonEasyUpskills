Question:-
Find employees who started in June and have even-numbered employee IDs.

Solution:-
# Import your libraries
import pandas as pd
import datetime as dt

# Start writing code
worker.head()

# Convert the 'joining_date' column to datetime format
worker["joining_date"] = pd.to_datetime(worker["joining_date"])

# Extract the month from the 'joining_date' column
worker["joining_month"] = worker["joining_date"].dt.month

# Filter rows where the month is June
feb_df = worker[worker["joining_month"] == 6]

# Further filter to include only rows with odd worker_id
odd_worker_df = feb_df[feb_df["worker_id"] % 2 == 0]

# Drop the 'joining_month' column
result = odd_worker_df.drop('joining_month', axis=1)
