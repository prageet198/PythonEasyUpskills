Question:-
Find the total costs and total customers acquired in each year.
Output the year along with corresponding total money spent and total acquired customers.

Solution:-
# Import your libraries
import pandas as pd

# Start writing code
uber_advertising.head()

# Firstly We will Group the data by 'year'
grouped_data = uber_advertising.groupby(['year'])

# After that we will apply Aggregation by summing up 'money_spent' and 'customers_acquired'
aggregated_data = grouped_data.agg({'money_spent': 'sum', 'customers_acquired': 'sum'})

# Finally we will Reset the index to turn 'year' back into a regular column
result = aggregated_data.reset_index()
