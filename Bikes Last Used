Question:-
Find the last time each bike was in use. Output both the bike number and the date-timestamp of the bike's last use (i.e., the date-time the bike was returned). 
Order the results by bikes that were most recently used.

Solution:-

df = dc_bikeshare_q1_2012

grouped = df.groupby('bike_number')['end_time'].max()

result = grouped.reset_index()
result = result.rename(columns={'end_time': 'last_time'})

result = result.sort_values(by='last_time', ascending=False)
