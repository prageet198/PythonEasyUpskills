Question:-
Find all top-rated wineries based on points.
Consider a top-rated winery has been awarded points more or equal than 95.

Solution:-
# Import your libraries
import pandas as pd

# Start writing code
winemag_p1.head()

# FIrst Of All We Will Filter the DataFrame to get only the rows where 'points' is 95 or more
filtered_df = winemag_p1[winemag_p1['points'] >= 95]

# Now We will Select only the 'winery' column from the filtered DataFrame
winery_df = filtered_df[['winery']]

# Remove duplicate winery names to get unique wineries only
unique_wineries = winery_df.drop_duplicates()
