Rank guests based on their ages.

Output the guest id along with the corresponding rank.

Order records by the age in descending order.

Solution:-
# Import your libraries
import pandas as pd

# Start writing code
airbnb_guests.head()

# Firstly calculate the rank based on age where highest age gets lowest rank
airbnb_guests['rank'] = airbnb_guests['age'].rank(ascending=False)

output = airbnb_guests[['guest_id', 'rank']].sort_values(by='rank')
