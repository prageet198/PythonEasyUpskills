Question:-
Find the number of reviews received by Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles for each star.
Output the number of stars along with the corresponding number of reviews.
Sort records by stars in ascending order.

Solution:-

# Import your libraries
import pandas as pd

# Start writing code
yelp_reviews.head()

# First Of All Filter the reviews to include only those for "Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles"
lolo = yelp_reviews[yelp_reviews['business_name'] == "Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles"]

# Then Group the filtered reviews by the 'stars' column and count the number of reviews for each star rating
review_counts = lolo.groupby('stars').size()

# After Grouping Convert the Series of review counts into a DataFrame with a column named 'n_reviews'
review_counts_df = review_counts.to_frame('no_reviews')

# Reset the index so 'stars' becomes a regular column in the DataFrame
review_counts_df = review_counts_df.reset_index()

# Finally Sort the DataFrame by the 'stars' column in ascending order
result = review_counts_df.sort_values('stars')
