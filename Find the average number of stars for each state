Question:-
Find the average number of stars for each state.
Output the state name along with the corresponding average number of stars.

Solution:-
# Import your libraries
import pandas as pd

# Start writing code
yelp_business.head()

# First Of All Group the DataFrame by the 'state' column
grouped_by_state = yelp_business.groupby(['state'])

# After Grouping Select the 'stars' column from the grouped data
stars_series = grouped_by_state['stars']

# Then Calculate the mean of the 'stars' column for each group (state)
average_stars = stars_series.mean()

# Now Convert the resulting Series to a DataFrame with the column name 'avg_stars'
average_stars_df = average_stars.to_frame('avg_stars')

# Finally Reset the index of the DataFrame to make 'state' a column again
result = average_stars_df.reset_index()
