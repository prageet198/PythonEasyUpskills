Question:-
Find whether hosts or guests give higher review scores based on their average review scores. Output the higher of the average review score rounded to 
the 2nd decimal spot (e.g., 5.11).
Solution:-

# Import your libraries
import pandas as pd

# Start writing code
airbnb_reviews.head()

# First Of All Group the DataFrame by 'from_type' and calculate the mean review score for each group
grouped_data = airbnb_reviews.groupby('from_type')['review_score'].mean()

# After That Convert the Series to a DataFrame
df = grouped_data.reset_index()

# Rename the column with the mean review scores
# The column with mean review scores is currently unnamed or named 'review_score'
# We will rename it to 'avg_score'
df = df.rename(columns={'review_score': 'avg_score'})

# Round the average review scores to 2 decimal places
df['avg_score'] = df['avg_score'].round(2)

# Finally Find the row with the highest average review score
# The nlargest function returns the top n rows with the highest values in the specified column
result = df.nlargest(1, 'avg_score')
