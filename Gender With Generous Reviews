URL:-https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/10149-gender-with-generous-reviews?code_type=2

Question:-
Write a query to find which gender gives a higher average review score when writing reviews as guests. Use the from_type column to identify guest reviews. 
Output the gender and their average review score.

Solution:-
# Import your libraries
import pandas as pd

# Start writing code
airbnb_reviews.head()

# Join the reviews and guests DataFrames based on matching user IDs
merged = pd.merge(airbnb_reviews, airbnb_guests, left_on='from_user', right_on='guest_id')

# Filter the joined DataFrame to include only rows where the from_type is 'guest'
merged = merged[merged['from_type'] == 'guest']

# Group the filtered data by gender and calculate the average review score for each gender
group = merged.groupby('gender')['review_score'].mean().reset_index()
group.columns = ['gender', 'avg_score']

# Find the gender(s) with the highest average review score
max_avg_score = group['avg_score'].max()
result = group[group['avg_score'] == max_avg_score]
