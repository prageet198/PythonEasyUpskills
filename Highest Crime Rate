Question:-
Find the number of crime occurrences for each day of the week.
Output the day alongside the corresponding crime count.

Solution:-
# Import your libraries
import pandas as pd

# Start writing code
sf_crime_incidents_2014_01.head()

# FIrst group the data by day of week
grouped_data = sf_crime_incidents_2014_01.groupby(['day_of_week'])

# In Next step count the number of occurance in each group
counts = grouped_data.size()

#In This step convert the counts in to data frame
counts_df = counts.to_frame(name='n_occurences')

# Now counts_df is a DataFrame with 'day_of_week' as the index and 'n_occurences' as the column.

counts_df_reset = counts_df.reset_index()
# The reset_index() function moves 'day_of_week' from the index to a regular column. The resulting DataFrame, counts_df_reset, has two columns: 'day_of_week' and 'n_occurences'.

sorted_result = counts_df_reset.sort_values(by='n_occurences', ascending=False)
sorted_result

# The sort_values() function sorts the DataFrame by the 'n_occurences' column in descending order. The DataFrame sorted_result will have the days with the highest number of occurrences at the top.
