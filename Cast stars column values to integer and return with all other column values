Question:-
Cast stars column values to integer and return with all other column values. Be aware that certain rows contain non integer values.

You need to remove such rows. You are allowed to examine and explore the dataset before making a solution.

Solution:-

# Import your libraries
import pandas as pd

# Start writing code
yelp_reviews.head()

# First Of All Filter out rows where the 'stars' column is '?'
filtered_reviews = yelp_reviews[yelp_reviews['stars'] != '?']

# In the Next Step We will Convert the 'stars' column to integers
filtered_reviews['stars'] = filtered_reviews['stars'].astype(int)

# Finally Print The result DataFrame now contains only rows with valid integer star ratings
result = filtered_reviews
