Question:-
Find players who participated in the Olympics representing more than one team. To detect multiple teams please inspect team column 
and how are multiple teams structured.

Output the player name, team, games, sport, and the medal.

Solution:-
# Import your libraries
import pandas as pd

# Start writing code
olympics_athletes_events.head()

# Filter the DataFrame to include only rows where 'team' contains '/'
contains_slash = olympics_athletes_events['team'].str.contains('/')

# Apply the filter to get a subset of the DataFrame
filtered_df = olympics_athletes_events[contains_slash]

# Select specific columns from the filtered DataFrame
result = filtered_df[['name', 'team', 'games', 'sport', 'medal']]
