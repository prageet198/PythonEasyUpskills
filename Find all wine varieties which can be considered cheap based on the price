Question:-
Find all wine varieties which can be considered cheap based on the price.
A variety is considered cheap if the price of a bottle lies between 5 to 20 USD.
Output unique variety names only.

Solution:-
# Import your libraries
import pandas as pd

# Start writing code
winemag_p1.head()

# 1. Filter the DataFrame to include only rows where the 'price' is between 5 and 20
filtered_df = winemag_p1[winemag_p1['price'].between(5, 20)]

# 2. Select only the 'variety' column from the filtered DataFrame
variety_df = filtered_df[['variety']]

# 3. Drop duplicate values from the 'variety' column
result = variety_df.drop_duplicates()
