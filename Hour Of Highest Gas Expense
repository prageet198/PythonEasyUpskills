Question:-
Find the hour with the highest gasoline cost. Assume there's only 1 hour with the highest gas cost.

Solution:-
# Import your libraries
import pandas as pd

# Start writing code
lyft_rides.head()

# Firstly we will Find the maximum value in the 'gasoline_cost' column
max_gasoline_cost = lyft_rides['gasoline_cost'].max()

# After that we will Create a boolean mask where the 'gasoline_cost' is equal to the maximum value
mask = lyft_rides['gasoline_cost'] == max_gasoline_cost

# Apply that  mask to filter rows of the DataFrame
filtered_rides = lyft_rides[mask]

# Now finally Select only the 'hour' column from the filtered DataFrame
result = filtered_rides[['hour']]
