Question:-
As a data scientist at Amazon Prime Video, you are tasked with enhancing the in-flight entertainment experience for Amazonâ€™s airline partners. 
Your challenge is to develop a feature that suggests individual movies from Amazon's content database that fit within a given flight's duration. 
For flight 101, find movies whose runtime is less than or equal to the flight's duration.

The output should list suggested movies for the flight, including 'flight_id', 'movie_id', and 'movie_duration'."

Solution:-
import pandas as pd

# Start writing code
entertainment_catalog.head()

flight_schedule.head()

combined_df = entertainment_catalog.merge(flight_schedule, how="cross")

filtered_df = combined_df[(combined_df["flight_id"] == 101) & (combined_df["duration"] <= combined_df["flight_duration"])]

result = filtered_df[["flight_id", "movie_id", "duration"]]
result
