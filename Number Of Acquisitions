Question:-
Find the number of acquisitions that occurred in each quarter of each year. Output the acquired quarter in YYYY-Qq format along with the number of 
acquisitions and order results by the quarters with the highest number of acquisitions first.

Solution:-

# Import your libraries
import pandas as pd

# Start writing code
crunchbase_acquisitions.head()

# Firstly Extract year and quarter from 'acquired_quarter'
year = crunchbase_acquisitions['acquired_quarter'].dt.year.astype(str)
quarter = crunchbase_acquisitions['acquired_quarter'].dt.quarter.astype(str)

# Next Create the 'quarter_year' new column
crunchbase_acquisitions['quarter_year'] = year + '-Q' + quarter

# After this Group by 'quarter_year' and count entries
counts = crunchbase_acquisitions.groupby('quarter_year').size()

# Now Convert counts to DataFrame and rename the column to 'size'
counts_df = counts.to_frame('size')

# Finally Reset index and sort values by 'size'
result = counts_df.reset_index().sort_values('size', ascending=False)
