Question:-
Find the review count for one-star businesses from yelp.
Output the name along with the corresponding review count.

Solution:-
# Import your libraries
import pandas as pd

# Start writing code
yelp_business.head()
# First Of All Filter the DataFrame to include only 1-star reviews
stars = yelp_business[yelp_business['stars'] == 1]

# After That Perform the Group by 'name' and 'review_count' and count the occurrences in each group
grouped = stars.groupby(['name', 'review_count'])
counts = grouped.size()

# Now Convert the counts to a DataFrame
counts_df = counts.to_frame()

# Reset index to get 'name' and 'review_count' as columns
counts_df_reset = counts_df.reset_index()

# Finally Select only the 'name' and 'review_count' columns
result = counts_df_reset[['name', 'review_count']]
