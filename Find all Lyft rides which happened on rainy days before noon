Question:-
Find all Lyft rides which happened on rainy days before noon.

Solution:-
# Import your libraries
import pandas as pd

# Start writing code
lyft_rides.head()

# Filter condition to check where the weather is rainy
weather_condition = lyft_rides['weather'] == 'rainy'

# Filter condition to check where the hour is between 0 and 11 inclusive
hour_condition = lyft_rides['hour'].between(0, 11)

# Combine both conditions using the & operator
combined_condition = weather_condition & hour_condition

# Apply the combined condition to the DataFrame
result = lyft_rides[combined_condition]
