Question:-
Find all posts which were reacted to with a heart. For such posts output all columns from facebook_posts table.
Solution:-
# Import your libraries
import pandas as pd

# On First Step We Will Filter for 'heart' reactions
filtered_reactions = facebook_reactions[facebook_reactions['reaction'] == 'heart']

# After Filtering Select only 'post_id' column
heart = filtered_reactions[['post_id']]

# Now Merge with facebook_posts DataFrame on 'post_id'
merged_data = pd.merge(heart, facebook_posts, on='post_id')

# Finally Remove duplicate 'post_id' entries
unique_posts = merged_data.drop_duplicates(subset='post_id')
