Request status can be either 'success' or 'fail'.
Output the request status along with the average cost.

Solution:-
# Import your libraries
import pandas as pd

# Start writing code
uber_ride_requests.head()

# Initially Group the data by 'request_status'
grouped_data = uber_ride_requests.groupby('request_status')

# After Grouping Calculate the mean of 'monetary_cost' for each group
mean_costs = grouped_data['monetary_cost'].mean()

# Finally Convert the result to a DataFrame and reset the index
result = mean_costs.reset_index()
